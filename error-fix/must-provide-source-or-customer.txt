For me the problem was that I was using v3 of Stripe's js. I used v2 and it works fine.

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://js.stripe.com/v2/"></script>﻿

Dipesh.  This won't work in the long run. All you are doing is removing the variable and hard coding the source called tok_mastercard.  we will want the variable in for live production because it returns the token from Stripe.  This is issue has something to do with the jquery in checkout.js not working and returning the variable.﻿

try to change "var token = result.token" to "var token = result.token.id" in checkout.js file﻿
